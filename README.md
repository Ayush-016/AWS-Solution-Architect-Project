üåê AWS Scalable & Secure Web Application Deployment
This project showcases a complete AWS-based cloud infrastructure for hosting a highly available, secure, and scalable PHP-based dynamic web application. Designed as part of a real-world scenario, it simulates responsibilities expected from a Cloud Architect, ensuring best practices in network isolation, database management, auto-scaling, disaster recovery, and global content delivery.

üìå Key Features
Isolated Network Environment using Amazon VPC with security groups and NACLs.

Managed Database with Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ) for automated backups, patching, and failover.

Disaster Recovery with EC2 and RDS backups using AWS Backup.

Auto-Scaling EC2 Instances: Maintain 2 minimum, scale up to 4 during high traffic.

High Availability via Application Load Balancer (ALB) and health checks.

Global Caching through Amazon CloudFront CDN for low-latency access worldwide.

Automated Monitoring & Incident Alerts via CloudWatch, Lambda, and Amazon SES.

Dynamic PHP Web Application connected to the RDS backend to store user input.
